# Quote Matcher: The Office
*A game by William Bowden & Robby Piwko*

## What Is It?
*Quote Matcher* is a game in which you match character quotes with the character who said them. We themed our game around the characters and wacky quotes found in the show *The Office*

## How To Play
Match the quote displayed at the top of the page with the character who you think said it by clicking the image of the character located below the quote.

## How It Was Made
*Quote Matcher* was created using basic/intermediate levels of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on RIT's web server at [this address](https://people.rit.edu/wjb5377/230/project2).

## Who Did What?
A bulk of the project was done in a group setting so that both of us could catch mistakes before we could even see the result of them. There were a few more design issues that were dealt with by Robby Piwko, and a few more logical issue that were dealt with by William Bowden.

## Issues We Faced
As stated above, issues were mostly dealt with during the process of writing the code due to the nature of working in a group. Any errors that slipped by initially were caught rather quickly simply by weeding out the possible causes until we found what was actually triggering our problems. 

One issue we caught relatively late was when activating the "Skip Quote" button after already having used the "Narrow it Down" button could result in the author of the new quote (the quote displayed after clicking skip quote) to have already been disabled/deativated from previously clicking "Narrow it Down" causing the user to be unable to select the correct author. We solved this problem by having the user essentially "forfeit" their "Narrow it Down" button by re-enabling all cards once the "Skip Quote" button is pressed.

## Sources
The character images were the only outside resources we used and they were found from various sources via Google Images.
