# Quote Matcher: The Office
*A game by William Bowden & Robby Piwko*

## What is it?
*Quote Matcher* is a game in which you match character quotes with the character who said them. We themed our game around the characters and wacky quotes found in the show *The Office*

## How to Play
Match the quote displayed at the top of the page with the character who you think said it by clicking the image of the character located below the quote.

## How it was Made
*Quote Matcher* was created using basic/intermediate levels of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on RIT's web server at [this address](people.rit.edu/wjb5377/230/project2) .
